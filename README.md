# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

My assignment was to build the back end for an e-commerce site, with the ability to manipulate listings of categories, products, and tags associated with them. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Do It Yourself

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

## Reflections on the Project

This project gives the user (inthis case, myself) a better understanding of how to use Postman, as well as a deeper understanding of back-end routing. Using multiple folderes with multiple files, this can get messy pretty quickly, so it helps to take your time andunderstand where each of the routes generates info from, how the pipelines feed data to the correct outputs, and above all else, take your time to double check that your names and tags are correct!
